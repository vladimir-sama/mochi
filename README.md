# 🎀 Mochi CLI 🎀
**Version 2025.10.21**

A tiny, cross-platform package fetcher and transfer tool —  
built with Python and Flask, wrapped in a pastel shell 💖

Mochi lets you **host**, **list**, and **fetch** files (like a mini Chocolatey/Scoop for Linux, Windows, and macOS).  
Perfect for quickly sharing builds, scripts, or archives between systems with integrity checks (SHA1).
